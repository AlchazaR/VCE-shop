# VCE-shop (small pet project)

##Online shop running on OpenCart engine.
Bash script downloads *.vce files from online and saves them locally.
PHP updates/inserts data in OpenCart database.

Idea was to have online store that doesn't require any manual work. It was working almost a year.... 
because it was most interesting to write code, than make SEO work:)
